Succeed to create a super basic github blog!

It has been a few days 'casue I didn't know that I have to use the same user name as mine.
Mine is "yeseung-jin" but I was using "yyssjjiinn" infront of ".github.io".

So what I got today is:
  1. the repository name should be the same as my user name.
  2. the url in _config.yml should be [username].git.io as well.

Tomorrow's goal is set sub-directories in here.
So it's done for today.
